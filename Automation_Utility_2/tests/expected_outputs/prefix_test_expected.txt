# Expected Output for Prefix Test

File Renamer Tool
Let's rename some files together!
I work on Windows, macOS, Linux, and even Termux on Android.

Which directory should I check (default: D:\Foundation Decmber\Automation_Utility_2\tests\test_prefix):

Great! I found 3 files in that directory:
  1. document.pdf
  2. file1.txt
  3. file2.txt

Let's decide how to rename them!

What kind of renaming would you like me to do?
1. Add a prefix (like 'old_' before each name)
2. Add a suffix (like '_backup' after each name)
3. Replace text (change 'old' to 'new' in names)
4. Add numbers (001, 002, 003, etc.)
5. Make all names lowercase
6. Make all names UPPERCASE
Enter your choice (1-6): 1
Enter prefix to add: test_

--- RENAME PREVIEW ---
  document.pdf -> test_document.pdf
  file1.txt -> test_file1.txt
  file2.txt -> test_file2.txt
--- END PREVIEW ---

This is just a preview. I can show you exactly what will happen before I make any changes.
Important: I will skip protected files like this script itself.
Should I go ahead and rename these files (y/n, default n): y
✓ Renamed: document.pdf -> test_document.pdf
✓ Renamed: file1.txt -> test_file1.txt
✓ Renamed: file2.txt -> test_file2.txt

--- SUMMARY ---
Files I looked at: 3
Files I renamed: 3
Everything went smoothly!

Thanks for using the File Renamer! Happy organizing!
