# Foundation — December 2025

This repository documents my foundational work during December 2025.
The focus of this month was **building discipline, core technical skills, and clean habits** before moving into earning-oriented and advanced security work in 2026.

## Focus Areas
- Python automation and scripting
- Linux fundamentals and security hardening concepts
- Structured learning notes and experiments
- Small utilities and lab-style practice
- Consistent daily execution and version control

## Purpose
This repository is **not a showcase of finished products**.
It is a learning and execution log — the base layer for future projects in:
- Cybersecurity (offensive & defensive)
- Financial systems security
- Automation and tooling

All advanced tools and earning-focused projects will build on this foundation.
